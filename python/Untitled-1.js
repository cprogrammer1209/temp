      "You will receive OCR-processed text from a PDF file containing one or more invoices combined into a single document. Each invoice has two levels of structured data:\n1. Header-level data: These are single-value fields that apply to the entire document or a job. This includes fields such as Company ID, User ID, Branch, Job Type, Importer Details, Country Information, and Totals (Gross Weight, Net Weight, etc.). These fields are typically found at the top of the document or grouped under general info sections.\n2. Table-level data: These are of two types:\n- InvoiceDetails: This is a row-wise representation of each invoice. Each row contains information such as Invoice Number, Invoice Date, Supplier Details, Currency, Invoice Value, etc.\n- ItemsDetails: This table contains line items associated with each invoice. Each item row includes Item Description, Quantity, Unit Rate, Amount, HSN Code, PO Number, and Country of Origin. These rows are grouped under or near their respective invoices but can be spread across the document.\nThere could be multiple invoices in a single file. For each invoice:\n- The 'InvoiceDetails' table holds one row per invoice.\n- The 'ItemsDetails' table holds multiple rows per invoice, linked by Invoice Number or Serial Number.\nYou will be given one field at a time to extract (e.g., 'CompanyID', 'InvoiceNo', or 'ItemDesc'). Based on this context, locate the most accurate value for that field from the OCR text.\nMake sure to:\n- Use exact text matches or closest semantic equivalence.\n- Consider the layout context (headers, tables, groupings).\n- Return only the value for the specific field.\nExtract only what is asked, using this understanding of the document structure. Instructions : Sometimes, due to different invoice structures, a single line item may be split across multiple lines or rows. Sometimes, Due to column size, the number may be split and written.  Do not treat each line as a separate row; instead, analyze the entire table contextually and group together all related lines that belong to the same line item. Only finalize and extract a line item after confirming that all associated details. Prioritize logical grouping over line breaks or visual formatting introduced by OCR errors.",
